Here are presentations I've given at various institutions and organizations in the US and Europe.

Exploring the English Language Network with Google N-Grams - 

This is presentation given in Laszlo Barabasi's Complex Networks class.   Here we were looking at Google's N-Grams dataset, particularly the juxtaposition of words.  We used the words as nodes, and the frequency of their juxtaposition as edge weights.  This allowed us to learn about English as a "Complex Network", which emerged as a result of human processes.

# Presentations

Here are presentations I've written or given at various institutions and organizations in the US and Europe, including MIT, Humboldt University, Bogazici University in Turkey, Netsci (conference on Complex Networks), the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, and the Center for Complex Networks Research in Boston, MA.


Exploring the English Language Network with Google N-Grams - 

This is presentation given in Laszlo Barabasi's Complex Networks class.   Here we were looking at Google's N-Grams dataset, particularly the juxtaposition of words.  We used the words as nodes, and the frequency of their juxtaposition as edge weights.  This allowed us to learn about English as a "Complex Network", which emerged as a result of human processes.

MIT Senseable Pecha Kucha -

This was a "pecha kucha" style (20 slides, 20 seconds each) talk I gave at Sandy Pentland's MIT Human Dynamics Lab, part of the Media Lab, as well as at Carlo Ratti's Senseable Cities Lab, also at MIT.

Complex Networks - 

This was prepared as an introductory talk for a group at TU-Berlin that was not familiar with Complex Networks.
Some pages were intentionally left blank as topics to mention but not go into detail about.

Netsci Urban systems -

This was a talk I prepared for an invited presentation at Netsci 2014 on my work on urban mobility scaling.


Presentation Sustainability Complex Systems - 

This talk was given when applying for a PhD position in Goettingen, Germany.  It addresses the connection and usefulness of complex systems when thinking about sustainability.
